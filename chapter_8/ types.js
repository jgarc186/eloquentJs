  * Types provide a useful framework for talking about programs. 
  * A lot of mistakes come from being confused about the kind of value that goes into or comes out of a function.

/**
  * When the types of a program are known, it is possible for the computer to check them for you, pointing out mistakes before the program is run. 
  * There are several JavaScript dialects that add types to the language and check them. 
  * The most popular one is called TypeScript. 
  * If you are interested in adding more rigor to your programs, I recommend you give it a try.
