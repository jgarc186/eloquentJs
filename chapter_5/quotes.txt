A large program is a costly program, and not just because of the time it takes to build. Size almost always involves complexity, and complexity confuses programmers. Confused programmers, in turn, introduce mistakes (bugs) into programs. A large program then provides a lot of space for these bugs to hide, making them hard to find.

 Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level.

 For example:

let total = 0, count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
  total += count;
  count += 1;
}
console.log(total);

The second relies on two external functions and is one line long.

console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));

It is a useful skill, in programming, to notice when you are working at too low a level of abstraction.

Higher-order functions: Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. 

Higher-order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values.

One area where higher-order functions shine is data processing.
